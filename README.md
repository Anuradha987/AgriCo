AgriCo is a software created for an agricultural company with the intent of helping farmers to sell their harvest in Sri Lanka. When developing the software, three main fruits that grow in Sri Lanka were considered. They are Pineapple, Mangus and Avocado. First, farmers who grow and sell the above three fruits can register with the system and they can enter their farms and fruit harvest details into the system. Then the AgriCo company purchases the harvest from them and later sells it to other companies like Keells, MD Jam, Tropicana, etc. 

The below table clearly explains the user roles and their tasks in the AgriCo system.
